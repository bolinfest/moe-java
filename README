RUNNING JAVA-MOE
****************
You can obtain the latest Java-MOE .jar from the Downloads page on our Google Code repository:
http://code.google.com/p/moe-java/downloads/list

Refer to the section BUILDING JAVA-MOE if you wish to compile your own.

Once you have the .jar, you can run:
"java -jar path/to/java-moe.jar <arguments for MOE>"

Alternatively, you can make the .jar executable and then run:
"./java-moe.jar <arguments for MOE>"
